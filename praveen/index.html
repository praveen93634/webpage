    <p>Hi, Guys today in this video I am going to share my long-term 9 months review on iPhone 14 and in this video, i am going to share a few positives & negatives.</p>

</h2>    
<p>It’s crazy that the 13 survived a full hour longer on only 7% than the 12. I feel like in a non-controlled environment there would be less of a gap, but the A15 and larger battery really shines in controlled tests.

    I know for a fact that the 13 series doesn’t last nearly as long as it does in battery tests when it’s in the real world. Why? My mom has a 13 Pro and went on a trip to a speech meeting (she is captain of my school’s speech team) and it was dead by the time they got back
